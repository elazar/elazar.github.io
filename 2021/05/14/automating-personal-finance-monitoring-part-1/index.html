        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Anyone who's known me a while knows that I'm not really happy with the status quo when it comes to accessibility of personal financial&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>I've often eschewed services like <a href="https://mint.intuit.com">Mint</a> in the past: while their interfaces may be helpful when it comes to examining trends or summarizing your overall financial position, I don't find them so useful for day-to-day management of finances or working toward financial&nbsp;goals.</p>
<p>There are many things that I like about <a href="/2014/03/29/ledger-basics-and-habits">Ledger</a>, but its accessibility to those not comfortable with a shell (e.g. my wife) is limited and it requires a substantial amount of data entry to be be optimally&nbsp;useful.</p>
<p>This data already exists within the financial institutions that I patronize; I just need a way of getting it out. Services like <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a> are good in concept, but I haven't found many solutions in that space, and the few I have seen have experienced relatively little adoption -- meaning that the number of financial institutions they work with are limited -- or generally target businesses rather than individual&nbsp;consumers.</p>
<p>In theory, I could log into each of my accounts everyday, download CSV dumps or copy and paste recent transactions from each one, compile them into a table, and reconcile them. However, that would be excessively time-consuming, tedious, error-prone, and pretty dull work. I wanted a better solution. So, I set about writing&nbsp;one.</p>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>The idea of automating the manual process I described above seemed a relatively solid way to approach the&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>My cursory examination of the sites with which I'd be interacting suggested that using a low-level HTTP client like <a href="https://curl.se">curl</a> wasn't going to be sufficient for my use case: basic interactions with these sites involved a lot of complex client-side code and HTTP requests that I didn't particularly want to pull apart and try to reproduce&nbsp;reliably.</p>
<p>The alternative, automating use of an actual browser, arguably amounts to doing what I or your average user of these sites would normally do manually and thus seemed like a better way to&nbsp;go.</p>
<h2>Stack</h2>
<p>I started by <a href="https://github.com/symfony/panther#installing-panther">installing <code>symfony/panther</code></a>. If you have <a href="https://www.phparch.com/books/web-scraping-with-php-2nd-edition/">my book</a>, you can find out more about this at the end of chapter 14. I supplemented this with <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/css_selector.html"><code>symfony/css-selector</code></a> to allow me to <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dom_crawler.html#node-filtering">filter DOM nodes using CSS selectors</a>, which tend to be more concise than XPath expressions; see chapter 13 and the start of chapter 14 for more&nbsp;details.</p>
<p>I also followed the <a href="https://github.com/symfony/panther#installing-chromedriver-and-geckodriver">recommendation of installing <code>dbrekelmans/bdi</code></a> to handle downloading and installing <a href="https://chromedriver.chromium.org/">chromedriver</a> and set it up as a <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md#command-events">Composer <code>post-install-cmd</code>&nbsp;script</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">/* composer.json */
{
    &quot;require&quot;: {
        &quot;dbrekelmans/bdi&quot;: &quot;^0.3.0&quot;,
        &quot;symfony/css-selector&quot;: &quot;^5.2&quot;,
        &quot;symfony/panther&quot;: &quot;^1.0&quot;
    },  
    &quot;scripts&quot;: {
        &quot;post-install-cmd&quot;: &quot;bdi driver:chromedriver drivers&quot;
    }   
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, I started writing code to log into one of the sites I would be extracting data from... and hit my first&nbsp;blocker.</p>
<h2>Impersonation</h2>
<p>The behavior of the target sites changed when I tried to use an automated browser rather than a manual one: login requests would&nbsp;fail.</p>
<p>I used Chrome Developer Tools to download a request sequence as a <a href="https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/">HAR file</a>. Combing through it, I noticed a reference to <code>webdriver</code> in one of the request&nbsp;payloads.</p>
<p>Additional digging turned up <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#interface">a related requirement in the WebDriver standard</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33225947/can-a-website-detect-when-you-are-using-selenium-with-chromedriver/52108199#52108199">a work-around for chromedriver</a> (bless Stack Overflow), which I incorporated into my&nbsp;project.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">/* composer.json */
{
    &quot;scripts&quot;: {
        &quot;post-install-cmd&quot;: &quot;./scripts/post-install-cmd.sh&quot;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># ./scripts/post-install-cmd.sh

#!/bin/bash
./vendor/bin/bdi driver:chromedriver drivers
sed -i 's/cdc_/dog_/g' drivers/chromedriver
</code></pre>
<p>This allowed me to get past the web application firewalls of most sites. However, there were a few for which this wasn't sufficient. More research turned up <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53039551/selenium-webdriver-modifying-navigator-webdriver-flag-to-prevent-selenium-detec/60403652#60403652">another measure</a> (again, bless Stack Overflow). This one was simpler and involved passing a CLI flag to chromedriver when invoking&nbsp;it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$client = \Symfony\Component\Panther\Client::createChromeClient(
  null,
  ['--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled']

<p>Apparently there are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/60647331/906821">numerous such ways</a> of fingerprinting an automated browser and, depending on the site, it can be difficult or next to impossible to find the right ones. Guess I just got lucky. Well,&nbsp;mostly...</p>
<h2>Authentication</h2>
<p>Once I got past the login form, I had to contend with other authentication&nbsp;measures.</p>
<p>One common such measure was security questions. These are typically few in number and configured through account settings ahead of time. It was easy enough to detect them, cross-reference the given question with a pre-programmed set of questions and corresponding answers, and bypass&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>The next such measure was more complicated: <a href="https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/">two-factor authentication</a>, or 2FA. Some sites offer e-mail as an option for 2FA, but many only offer SMS. So I had to figure out how to bypass both&nbsp;cases.</p>
<p>For e-mail, I wanted messages used for 2FA to be as short-lived as possible: my script would log in to the relevant web site and initiate 2FA, then check an e-mail account, locate the message, extract the 2FA code from it, and delete the&nbsp;message.</p>
<p>At first, I tried using Panther to access Gmail via its web UI. Unfortunately, Google's fingerprinting is fairly aggressive, and I wasn't able to figure out a quick way to bypass their login&nbsp;form.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found a different way: a new Gmail account with <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255">&quot;Less secure app access&quot;</a> (air quotes intentional) turned on that I would access using the <a href="https://www.php.net/imap"><code>imap</code> extension</a> together with the <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/ddeboer/imap"><code>ddeboer/imap</code></a> library. The latter made it possible to access messages with an object-oriented API and very little&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>This took care of the e-mail case, but I didn't know of an easy way to have my script automatically check text messages. It's possible I could've used something like <a href="https://www.twilio.com/sms">Twilio</a> for this, but that seemed like overkill. I also didn't want to lose the ability to receive 2FA text messages on my phone when I was trying to log into my account&nbsp;manually.</p>
<p>2FA messages typically come from a dedicated number or have common identifying text in the content. The solution I ended up going with was using an app similar to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frzinapps.smsforward">this one</a> to automatically forward SMS messages meeting specific criteria to my new Gmail account, which my script would then access just as it did for institutions using e-mail for&nbsp;2FA.</p>
<h2>Alerts</h2>
<p>I can get away with only checking some accounts once per day. However, many financial institutions offer e-mail alerts for specific conditions, such as withdrawals, deposits, or transfers above a certain amount. This is useful for knowing when accounts need to be checked for&nbsp;changes.</p>
<p>In cases where multiple e-mail addresses were supported, I set up alerts using my new e-mail account. In cases where only a single or primary e-mail address was supported for alerts, I set up <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en">filters</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957?hl=en">forwarding</a> to send specific alerts to the new&nbsp;account.</p>
<p>At that point, I was able to write a script that checks the new e-mail account every few minutes, identifies any new messages instigated by alerts and their sources, and checks those sources for changes to balances or recent&nbsp;activity.</p>
<h2>Legwork</h2>
<p>With the more challenging aspects behind me, all that remained was writing code to navigate through web interfaces; bypass any prompts, modals, or special offers; and extract and parse current account balances and dates, descriptions, amounts, and (where available) running balances from recent activity&nbsp;postings.</p>
<p>I still need to write code to store this data and reconcile it, but that's a subject for another post. Hope you enjoyed hearing about my experiences with this project. Thanks for&nbsp;reading!</p>
